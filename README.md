##Tying it all together

##Purpose
Let's see how all of the technologies that we've covered can be brought together into a single webpage.

##Directions
Fork and clone this repository. Follow the instructions below.

## 1. project set up 
Change your working directory into the cloned directory. Initialize a node project with the following command.

```
npm init
```
respond to the prompts. When you're done, it will have created a package.json file.

You can now install dependencies with the following command

```
npm install --save <dependency name>
```

Try installing express. Check the package.json file to make sure that it's installed.

Now create a folder for hosting static files (static means files that are not generated by source code). Name the folder public. It should be in the root folder of your project.

Create an html file called index.html in the public folder. For now, make it simple, you can put whatever you want in it.

##2. Create a static server.

Express makes it easy to serve static files. Create an express server and use the static file server middleware to serve the html file that you created. If your server is listening on port 3000, if you direct your web browser to http://localhost:3000 you should be able to see the webpage you created. Add a css folder to public and try adding a simple css file to your html page.

##3. Create your first API route.

Let's make a site to rank Javascript practice questions. The site will have a list of javascript questions. These questions will have an id, and people can vote for them if they like them.

So let's imagine what a question object might look like.

var question = {
	question: "Write a function to sum all the numbers in an array"
	id: 1,
	votes: 0
}

create a variable, questions, that holds a list of data of this type. Write a GET route that retrieves all of the questions in the array and returns them as a json object. Turn on your server and test out this route with the postman application.
